  <p>
    Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling,
    and management of applications using containerization. It provides a way to
    package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.
    Containers are isolated, lightweight, and portable, allowing applications to run
    consistently across different environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    With Docker, you can build, distribute, and run containers on various operating systems
    and cloud platforms. It simplifies the process of software development, testing,
    and deployment by providing a consistent environment and eliminating the "it works on
    my machine" problem. Docker also facilitates microservices architecture, allowing
    applications to be composed of small, independent, and scalable services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Docker is widely used in the industry and has a vibrant ecosystem. It enables developers
    and organizations to adopt a container-based approach to modernize their applications,
    improve scalability, enhance security, and streamline the software delivery pipeline.
